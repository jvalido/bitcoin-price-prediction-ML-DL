## 🔍 Features
- Predicts Bitcoin prices using:
  - Ridge Regression
  - Lasso Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Hyperparameter tuning for better predictions.
- Data fetched using yfinance.
- Evaluate models with Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² metrics.
- Visualize predictions and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves.

## 📊 How It Works
The application fetches historical Bitcoin price data using the yfinance API. It then uses various algorithms to build predictive models. Here’s a simplified overview of the workflow:

1. Data Collection: Fetch historical data.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare data for analysis.
3. Model Training: Strengthen predictions using various algorithms.
4. Results Visualization: Present the predictions and model performance.
